    "Recent advances in cloud-computing technologies and remote sensing data availability foster the development of studies based on the analysis of optical and SAR imagery time series (TS). In this paper, we explore Sentinel-1 imagery time series and different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures for the task of grassland detection in the northern Brazilian Amazon. We used the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform as an alternative to obtain and pre-process the Sentinel-1 imagery TS, acquired from 2017 to 2018 over the region of Mojuí dos Campos/PA, Brazil. In addition, we implemented the classification and validation procedures using the Python language. We performed classifications using both the original TS and temporal metrics extracted from the imagery TS. In this study, we also evaluated the potential of different ANN architectures, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). In addition, we analysed the time series considering different channels, including both the VV and VH polarizations and the CR, RGI and NL indices. We could efficiently discriminate areas of grasslands from forest and agricultural crops in the northern Brazilian Amazon, using the original VH TS and the LSTM architecture. The classification map resulting from this classification setup presented an overall accuracy of 90% and a 0.85 kappa index. Despite simple, the approach adopted in this paper showed potential to differ grasslands from areas of agriculture and forest in the northern Brazilian Amazon.\n",

In this flowchart, we consider as input data the imagery TS already pre-processed, composed of orthorrectified and filtered images obtained in two different polarizations (VV and VH). We used these channels to compute three different radar indices: the VH/VV polarization ratio, defined here as cross ratio (CR); a normalization ratio (NL); and, the Radar Gap Index (RGI). The products resulting from these indices aggregate information from both polarizations.\n",
